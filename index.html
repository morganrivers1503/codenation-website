<p>As someone that wants to visit Japan in the near future i have done a lot of research on the activites i can get up too in japan. As a big lover of japanese car culture and the culture in general (anime, food bars and much more) i think i can help to persuade anyone who came across my website to also want to visit Japan.

    Japan is an exhilarating and unique destination that also happens to be incredible safe, which makes it a great fit for families travelling with kids of any age.

Let Tokyo dazzle the whole family. Feast on market-fresh sushi, try your hand at calligraphy and cook your own okonomiyaki on a cruise around Tokyo Bay.

Ride the Hakone ropeway then relax in the soothing waters of an onsen. These hot-spring baths are the perfect antidote to a couple of days of walking around Tokyo.

From the tiny stalls in the back streets of Tokyo to the Nishiki-Koji Market, your leader will help you and your family navigate Japan’s dizzying cuisine and find something for everyone.

Learn about an important chapter of Japan’s history at the Hiroshima Peace Park, followed by a visit to the relaxing island of Miyajima where deer roam the streets.

<p>If your into cars and more especially custom Cars such as JDM's, Drags and "ricers" Japan is allmost definetly for you the car culture and custom cars in japan are definetly very exclusive to japan.

    Japanese car culture is unique and exciting, but why is it so different? At first glance, the most obvious reason is that Japan has always had access to cheap performance cars. This is the birthplace of car manufacturers like Honda, Subaru, Nissan, Toyota, Mazda, and Mitsubishi. 
    
    These companies have competed with each other for decades, pushing performance boundaries and developing new technologies. This resulted in the production of some of the most iconic vehicles – the Supra, Skyline and the RX-7.

    Kunimitsu Takahashi is a Japanese motorcycle racer who is known as the first person to use the technique of drifting. Young street races emulate his driving style and practice on touge mountain passes. One of them is Keiichi Tsuchiya, who is known as the Drift King for taking Takahashi's techniques to the next level.

    Daikoku parking area is a motorway rest spot that happens to be a place of worship for Japanese car enthusiasts. This is where your Tokyo Drift dreams come to life. There is everything from the obscure to the insane. This is where you can find an R32 Skyline GT-R standing next to a Nissan 350Z.

<p>Anime is proabably one of the standing stones of identifying something Japanese and is a massive part of there culture. Its so popular over there that there are bars and shops that are open 24/7 and are a big part of the night life over there.

    Anime is a style of Japanese film and television animation, typically aimed at adults as well as children. Compare with manga.Anime is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation
    Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques.

    Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots.
