here are some images that i have used threw out my website this is the last page in my website and i hope you liked it and have hopefully been perusaded to vistit japan. it can be a beutiful place and is a great experience. I understand Japan isnt for everyone as it doesnt feel like a "proper holiday" as its not all sun beach and glamour. But it is a very pretty holiday and i belive it has some breathtaking views both nature and urban city based.
